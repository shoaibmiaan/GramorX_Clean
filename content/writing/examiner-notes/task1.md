# Examiner notes — Task 1

Common reasons people lose 0.5:
- Missing or vague overview.
- Listing numbers without grouping/comparing.
- Inconsistent data accuracy or rounding.
- No mention of main change/ranking.
- Overusing one linker (e.g., "also").

Band 6 → 7 moves:
- State an overview that highlights dominant trends and largest shifts.
- Group similar categories before giving figures.
- Use range for vocabulary (rise, climb, remain stable) without repetition.
- Keep one decimal style; avoid unnecessary exactness.

Band 7 → 8 moves:
- Prioritise key comparisons; avoid covering every data point.
- Use concise complex sentences to link ideas naturally.
- Mix summary verbs with precise figures when necessary.
- Maintain consistent tense for projections vs. past.

Template/memorised language penalties:
- Over-generic openings ("The chart is very important...") lower TR.
- Recycled overviews that ignore this chart hurt CC and TR.

Cohesion mistakes that kill CC:
- New paragraph for each tiny detail.
- Repeating "also/and" instead of varied referencing.
- Mixing time references (past vs. future) inside one sentence.
