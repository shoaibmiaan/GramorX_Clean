# Examiner notes — Task 2

Common reasons people lose 0.5:
- Position unclear or shifts mid-essay.
- One-sentence paragraphs with weak topic sentences.
- Examples too generic or unrelated.
- Overused connectors ("On the other hand" every paragraph).
- Under-length or missing conclusion.

Band 6 → 7 moves:
- State stance in the introduction and restate in the conclusion.
- Use topic sentences that preview the paragraph's idea.
- Provide specific, relevant examples (not generic "people say").
- Keep 4–5 paragraphs with logical progression.

Band 7 → 8 moves:
- Develop each idea with cause → effect → example flow.
- Vary cohesion devices (reference words, substitution) not just conjunctions.
- Use precise lexis for argumentation (undermines, reinforces, incentivises).
- Limit hedging and filler phrases; be concise.

Template/memorised language penalties:
- Boilerplate essays with minimal adaptation trigger lower TR and LR.
- Stock phrases that ignore question specifics reduce credibility.

Cohesion mistakes that kill CC:
- Paragraphs that start mid-example without a clear claim.
- Repetition of the same linking phrase.
- Abrupt shifts without reference back to the thesis.
